Jadu Perfect Council Homepage - Exercise


Instructions below:
 
We require you to build a static html mockup, with SASS/JS, based on the PSD provided.
 
In house we use build tasks such as Gulp, if this is something you are familiar with then please do use it.

We would like to see demonstration of clean, readable code. e.g. BEM syntax & modular JS
 
We would prefer you to use vanilla JS or jQuery, however if you are more familiar with a framework e.g. Bootstrap or Zurb Foundations then this is fine.
 
Please use any Javascript where you see fit, whether that is writing your own or utilising a plugin (npm), either way we would like to see some animations on elements such as search and menu items, carousels etc.
 
All of our sites should meet Accessibility standards of 2.1, this is important for us to see you meeting some of these standards on these html pages. A little hint: we use chrome extensions such as 'Wave' and 'SiteImprove' to highlight issues and to correct them, please do your best to ensure most if not all the issues are corrected.
 
You can upload to git or bitbucket, or if you prefer a zip file is ok.
